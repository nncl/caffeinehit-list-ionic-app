# Caffeinehit List - Ionic App

## Corrections

### No results found or yelp API error

- We use an API in this app which returns a list of coffee shops "near you"
- We use the yelp.com api and sometimes this may not have results in your area.
- So if the API returns an error like `no results found` or `yelp API error` then just **hardcode** the latitude and longitude that came with the starter project, do not try to use your own lat and lon.
